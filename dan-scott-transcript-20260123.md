0:00 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  welcome to the new world of stuff yeah um so i put together a little prototype it might be hard to look at on your phone but let me show you here oh wow so this and this is just like basically um sorry my mouse is going wigging out this is all just based on like every all the files you sent me okay so i'll tell you my secrets because i usually don't tell people my secrets because all i did was take your files drop it into a folder on my computer and say make this website yeah i tried that google stitch thing it wouldn't listen to anything i said um so this could be a good start the photo that you sent here  It looks like you're smushed, and I thought it was the way that this was showing up, but it's actually the photo.  I don't know.

1:09 - daniel
  It looks good. It looks okay on my end. This looks okay?

1:13 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Yeah, I don't see it smushed. Maybe it's me. So, you know, for mobile, we can work that out. Yeah, I don't know.  Did I send you the zip file? Yeah, you did. Yep. And I have all those photos in there. Yeah, like it looks like, I can't exactly put my finger on it.  Like, it looks processed in some way.

1:40 - daniel
  I had it put. So the original picture was in my studio with like the purple lighting background. Right. So I had to edit all that out, and then into a white background.  Did you do that yourself?

1:53 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  ChatGPT did it.

1:55 - daniel
  Okay. Because there might be a better way to do it because I could tell like the picture.

2:00 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  It looks a little funky.

2:04 - daniel
  Do you want to send me the original?

2:06 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Yeah, so hold on.

2:07 - daniel
  Let me send it to you now. So the one I just sent you was the original photo.

2:27 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Okay. Let me see what I can do.

2:29 - daniel
  Oh, I just sent a few texts just so you could see it. You want me to email it?

2:33 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Yeah, it looks blurry. It may not be the high-red, like as high-red as you had. Yeah, let me try that again.  Yeah, email it. Well, the picture itself, like without putting it through, it's not going to be high-resolution.

2:47 - daniel
  That's the problem.

2:48 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Do you have a high-resolution picture that you might want to use instead of this?

2:52 - daniel
  No, I had AI convert everything. So I had it do it here. Let me see what I can do with it.  Well, because Beth was like... Like saying something about that photo, you know, about the bodybuilders.

3:03 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  like when I blow it up, here, let me just share my whole screen here. When I blow it up like this from your phone, like it looks, it looks fuzzy.  Do you see that? Yeah. So that's what I want to avoid. There might be ways to sharpen it up, which I can try.  Yeah. I just, I hate that with the background.

3:26 - daniel
  So I'm going to actually send you a different one. Hold on. Cause that didn't like that one anyway. But, um, um, here, I just sent you a zip file with a different photo.  I don't know. Maybe it looks a little cleaner. You sent it over email. Yeah. Okay.

3:44 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  That's come in that one.

3:46 - daniel
  It was a little, I didn't have to like really mess with lighting. It was already a, um, like a, whatever photo guy.  I don't know. That one might actually look clearer. So that too.

3:59 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  That there's wearacoan lights the just esto You

4:09 - daniel
  Okay, I just got that, let me grab that file, but yeah, the concept, like I said, the whole point of this is to just be so simple because it's really just an avenue to get a little information, apply for coaching.  The main thing is, and I have those two, I have them all, is like setting up a thing with you for some auto-generated email response stuff and that kind of stuff, so it's like, I think I sent you the intake form, they got to fill out for the application, and then there's some return emails and all that stuff, and then I have...

4:53 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  This could, look at this.

4:58 - daniel
  Looks very grainy. It's very grainy, and you can see the Band-Aid still there.

5:09 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Watch. Okay.

5:19 - daniel
  Yeah, Beth thinks the other one I sent you might be less intimidating. It is intimidating, I'm not gonna lie.  This one? All of you, all of them.

5:34 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  I'm familiar with these, these other ones you sent.

5:39 - daniel
  Yeah, so that one I had ChatGPT turn that into high resolution and like fix it and adjust it and do all that stuff.  So I don't know, that one might look a little better.

5:52 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Okay, let's just see if this, the Band-Aid's gone. Band-Aid's gone. Oh, there we go. Yeah. But yeah, like it does look kind of like, you know, there's like weird detail on there.  But it might be it might be able to soften it up from there a little bit and get it somewhere in between when you open up the other file with the other picture does that one look a little better?

6:15 - daniel
  The ones you just sent?
  ACTION ITEM: Remove background from Daniel's preferred photo; place on site background - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/_pJxvsJyS4759DdvEzqZ8ggxq9NxK-ge?timestamp=392.9999

6:16 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Yeah. Let me, let me see here. Hang on. Yeah, looks a little better. These are that's a decent resolution.  Yeah, these are these are these could work this one. I could remove the background and then put it over the same like background that we have here.  You know what I mean?

6:52 - daniel
  Is the other background like better because the other one has like a little bit like that gym look to it or does it look stupid?  I don't know. I like that.

6:58 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  I like the look of this. what Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You know what I mean? It's really up to you though, you know, but, um, whatever you think is a little industrial, this looks like a little industrial to me.  Okay. Um, so yeah, but, um, either way, like that, that part's easy to swap out over time. Like if you decide you're like, ah, I want to change that up.

7:21 - daniel
  So yeah, the other picture is probably better. This one might look a little more body, like I'm not trying to get bodybuilders.  And that was her point. She's like, well, it looks like you're just trying to get Like bodybuilders. Yeah. Um, I get that.

7:34 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Uh, so we have like connect apply for online coaching. Is that the only like contact you want? Like the, no.

7:45 - daniel
  So under the connect, that's where I'm just going to show that that'll just be a quick, um, I guess like a dropdown bar that'll just like, as soon as you click it, we'll just automatically send you to, uh, you know, the connect that, you know, whatever.

8:00 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  So you want this to email you? Yeah. So that's why I want to set up those emails.

8:07 - daniel
  The apply for coaching, I want that to link directly right to the intake form that I think I sent you.  Yeah, you did, yeah. ChatGPT made a version of it fillable, but the one I showed you, I want the intake form to be like that, for it to be fillable, for them to be able to just fill in the questions, and then at the bottom just be able to click a submit button, and the submit button will go right to the connect at, you know, danscottfitness, dan at, you know, the connect at danscottfitness.com email.  Yeah. And then this way I can, you know, look at that, and then I'll have like the emails, like I have a bunch of emails already made that'll like respond to that, you know, oh, thank you for, you know, reaching out and all that stuff.  So I have a bunch of emails already made. Yeah. I just, I don't know how to set any of that stuff up.

9:11 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Okay. We'll do it. I'm doing it now. Um, it's as easy as just saying, make it intake form. I mean, you know, there's more complexity cause like the backend has to be hooked up and stuff like that.  But you know, like this website, like I could put this up on a server right now. Yeah. Okay.

9:31 - daniel
  That's cool. Right.

9:32 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  It's just a matter of like filling out. Yeah.

9:34 - daniel
  That's why I like, it's not over like how we were always, we had like pages to go to and stuff.  It's meant to be very just professional basic. It's all about just like learning a little bit because most of it's going to be coming from like social media.  So this is really just going to be to give, like, I might add one more tab on there or something, but like, it's basically like straightforward.  You got a tab there that'll fill in that stuff that I gave you on how the coaching works. So that's right here, right?

10:02 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  So if we go to how coaching works, it jumps down the page. And this, and this is all from that document.

10:10 - daniel
  Right. And then what's included.

10:12 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  So it's, which I think is honestly the right way to handle this.

10:15 - daniel
  Okay.

10:16 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  I wouldn't make separate pages. I think having one page. Well, that's, that's what I was thinking.

10:20 - daniel
  Instead of overcomplicating it to multiple pages, it doesn't need to be. Exactly. So like when you click on like initial call and alignment, and then like, what are those do?

10:33 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Nothing. There's no, you don't click on these.

10:36 - daniel
  So is it, should, do I need two separate ones or did you just automatically separate it from what I gave you?

10:44 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  I don't know when you, when you say separate it from what you gave me, what do you mean? Exactly.

10:51 - daniel
  Like, is there, did I give you two separate things for like the initial call and alignment and your coaching setup stuff?  I don't, I don't remember. I'm checking.

11:01 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Those are all images, this is all image, you gave me an intake form, a- What's the intake form?

11:12 - daniel
  That's the one they got to fill out? Yeah, that's with all like asking all that information. Okay. And then I think I gave you one that's just titled How Coaching Works.  Yep.

11:23 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  So that's all of that went into this area. Okay.

11:30 - daniel
  Well, that's why I was saying, because you had two different menu options there. Oh, wait. So wait, wait, I'm just curious.  So the one, two, and three.

11:42 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Apply for coaching, initial call alignment, your coaching setup. Apply for coaching, initial call alignment, your coaching setup. So it's just, it's just taking this and basically like laying it out this way.  Oh, oh, oh, okay.

11:57 - daniel
  I thought like it was something like you click on. Okay. No, it brings you to the, okay, I get it.  I get it.

12:06 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  So, yeah, so that's all here.

12:10 - daniel
  That, that, all that fit on that little part or what was that? All the information that was on that, that how coaching works is there or it was like shortened.

12:24 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  I think it's all there. It actually looks like there's more on the webpage than there is here. On the call, we'll talk you through your goals, review your schedule and lifestyle, discuss expectations around training, nutrition, and accountability, make sure we're, yeah, it's all, it's the same.  Oh, okay. Your onboarding approach is built around structure, accountability, adaptation, and sustainability designed to be realistic, repeatable, and maintainable long-term.  So it's shortening some of this.

12:57 - daniel
  Yeah, see, that's important because those are like the four. The pillars of, like, everything. So those are important. Okay.

13:03 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Okay. So that's actually should be laid out a little bit differently? Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. I don't know.  It's taking forever to think. Stop it.

13:15 - daniel
  Yeah, because the whole idea is, like, it's meant to look like a lot because it's like, this is what you're getting for your money.  You're getting, like, all this stuff. Right. Of how it works and what goes on. So that's, I just don't want it to look like it's like, oh, what is this?  What? Sorry. I just don't want it to look, like, minimal when it comes to, like, explaining because the whole page is basically mostly just how the coaching process works because the whole page is just about signing up for coaching.  Gotcha.

13:46 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Yeah, I've got some ideas. Okay, cool. So once this page is together, you bought the domain, right?

13:56 - daniel
  Yeah.

13:57 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  There's the website called Vercel. I'll tell this is where i host all of my websites basically for free and i think it would be ideal if you just created your own account and then i can do all the setup for you okay and basically like you just hook this up to your um namecheap domain and then you upload your website and that's that and you get it i told you you have to explain things like i'm five it's easy uh and then you're gonna want to get google workspace okay and then like your emails can be set up through google workspace okay um and i can put those like on my phone yeah absolutely it behaves just like gmail okay and that way you can hook up your domain your like email address to your domain all right well one of the chances like

15:00 - daniel
  I can meet up with you and you can help walk me through all that because you do not want to do that.

15:04 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  mean, um, just, just sign up for the services and like get the accounts and then, and then I can just hook it all up for you.
  ACTION ITEM: Email Daniel setup instructions: Vercel + Google Workspace; then Daniel creates accounts - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/_pJxvsJyS4759DdvEzqZ8ggxq9NxK-ge?timestamp=909.9999

15:12 - daniel
  All right. Let me take notes of everything you need me to do. Okay. So, all right. What was the first thing?

15:20 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  So you're going to go to, I can send you, I can follow up an email with instructions if that's easier.  Oh yeah. That'd be great. So I'm recording the meeting, so I'll just take the notes and say like, Hey, make instructions for Dan.

15:32 - daniel
  Okay. Perfect. Yeah. the next step is like step-by-step and for retarded people. I'm good. Yeah.

15:38 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  So you're just going on a start of an account with Vercel.

15:41 - daniel
  Okay.

15:42 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Um, and Google workspace. And then, and then we can meet at some point, maybe like early next week. Yeah.  Too bad. Um, and I, I might be around this. weekend. I'm not sure. Like we can keep in touch and see where the.  Where the schedule goes, but yeah, then once you have those accounts, we just upload the website, we attach it to your domain, and then Google gets set up with your email addresses and domain also, and then that's basically it.

16:17 - daniel
  Now with Google workspace, if set up the emails and stuff with that, can I still set up like, say somebody fills out the intake form and submits, am I able to set up auto-generated email that will automatically go to them once they do that?  Yeah, the short answer is yes.

16:40 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  We might have to like, look into the best way to enable that. But yeah, you can, you can, you have, yes.

16:49 - daniel
  Is it worth doing that? Or should I just keep, like somehow keep the emails that I use for that stuff like on file, and then I could just  Just type in their name and just send them out because I'm not working with that many people like the idea of this is to hang like, you know, 10 to 15 clients, you know, online coaching at a time.  So, I mean, I can do that manually. It's really not right.

17:13 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  So if you're so if someone hits that button and fills out the form and then as soon as they hit submit an email gets sent to you and then you, you know, have that pop up on your phone and you can respond to it or whatever like that.  That's very easy.

17:30 - daniel
  So I is like say I do it all on the laptop. Is there a way I can save like the pre-made like context for the emails like here so that like I can just go in and I can reply and just like type in their name and the subject will already be done?

17:46 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Um, yes, so like so like what you want is sort of like a draft email created. Yeah, so basically I would just like I guess copy and paste it in.  Um, well, there's there's a lot of ways you can handle. it. You could like have a Google Sheet where that captures the information, right, so like all of the information just gets set up as a new row in a Google Sheet.  Don't know what that means, but okay. just means that like if you're, you know, working with... I don't ever use Google, so I'm not familiar with it at all.  It's just one option, but you could have like a sheet that just, as people fill it out, a new row is filled out with their information, email, name, you know, , right?

18:31 - daniel
  Oh, it's like, so when they hit submit, it captures it and stores it there? Yeah, that's one option.

18:36 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  And then you can go reference it as needed or, you know, and have an email sent to you every time one is received.  What do mean? Like you could, so like if someone, so if I'm a interested trainer, I fill this out, I hit submit.  After I hit submit, you get an email notification that someone filled out your form. ... ... ... Inside the body of that email is all of the information, and all of the information is also captured on a spreadsheet, so you have it here.  Yeah, that would be like optimal.

19:12 - daniel
  Yeah.

19:13 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  So that's pretty easy to set up. It may, I have to see if there's a way to do it without like piling on additional services.

19:22 - daniel
  Yeah, I mean, I don't really need it to capture, as long as like I get their information in the email.  Yeah. Really all I need. I mean, I really don't need this whole capture thing, because as long as I have the email, I can print it out and just put it in a folder.
  ACTION ITEM: Implement intake form: validation + email Daniel on submit - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/_pJxvsJyS4759DdvEzqZ8ggxq9NxK-ge?timestamp=1172.9999  Yeah. Yeah, that's easy. You know, like I want simplicity. I'm not looking to overcomplicate things at all. Right.

19:43 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Yeah. No, that's, that's very easy to do it. I don't know why this is shitting the bed today.

19:49 - daniel
  So as long as when they hit submit, it sends me the form to my email to look at, then that's really all I need.  Yeah.

19:58 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  And then that's. Oh, and then this.

20:00 - daniel
  I can respond to it with a pre-drafted email that I've already made, and all I've got to do with that is put their name in it so that it looks more personal.  Yeah, that's easy.

20:21 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Because I have a couple things like that.

20:23 - daniel
  So it's like once they submit and they do the email, they get like the email back, you know, thanking them for taking the time for the application.  And it like basically gives like the next steps like, you know, I guess of allowing me just to review their information to go over this and blah, blah, blah.  And then I think it, you know, the next step I think is once I review it, if we're a good fit, you know, I think they get another email or whatever it is to schedule.  Like a call, you know, like, you know, basically like a whatever, you know. Yeah. I think like I have a whole like on boat, like an onboarding thing.  Yep. So like, am I able to set up something like, I mean, I can always just do it over email or whatever.  Am I able to set up something where like on the website, they can actually go in or whatever. And like, I can have like time availabilities and they can schedule a call.

21:27 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Yeah. So I use Calendly for that. Yeah. That actually came up on my thing, but Google workspace offers that too.  Okay.

21:37 - daniel
  So you may not need to.

21:45 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  So, yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's, it's really up to you how you want to handle it all.  Yeah.

21:51 - daniel
  Like I said, I just want whatever is like the easiest thing possible. Like, I'm just like trying to go through and look.  So like, so going through what I. So like landing page stuff, strategies, I'll bear with you one second, intake form, yeah, like, so I have stuff like I want to see, so like there's a weekly check-in form, I'm actually just going to send it to you quick, mail, I just sent that to you, so basically what this does is to save time, like every week, you know, at the end of the week of their like coaching or whatever, you know, that they've done what they're supposed to do, basically they go in, they fill out their week, because they're going to do a weekly check-in call with me, Yeah.  So... There's a weekly check in form. instead of having to like get on a call and cover a bunch of information, I have them fill out, you know, so I want to make this kind of like fillable as well for them.  Yeah. So that it's just like, you know, like name the week of it's like training execution. It asks like, how many sessions did you complete this week?  Were there any Mr. You know, modified sessions, the nutrition section, how closely were you able to follow your plan?  What went, you know, well, this week, your recovery, winds, obstacles, looking ahead, you know, it asks. So you want to add a form that captures all of that to the website?  I don't know if it has to capture to the website. I just, instead of having to constantly mail everybody a weekly check in form.  Like if there was a way, yeah, like to have, I guess, like a secondary kind of like button on there where they can like automate emails, right?

23:53 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Like you can set up an email campaign thing that is going to, um, Automate all of that.

24:03 - daniel
  So what, like every week on a certain day, it sends them their weekly check-in form? Yeah. Because I didn't know if it was easier just to have the form on the website.  So everybody could just click the same thing, go on, fill it out. It's you, really. I'm just asking you, I don't know what's easier or what sounds better.  Like, it's like, no, because then I guess you could have random people probably hitting check-in forms if they go on the site, unless, like, there's a way to set it up separately.  Yeah.

24:37 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  I would say, like, take one step at a time here, you know, maybe get through this part first and then figure that, that out, tweak all that stuff.

24:47 - daniel
  Yeah.

24:49 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Cause you're, you know, you're talking about additional complexity.

24:53 - daniel
  Okay.

24:55 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Uh, which is not a bad thing, but yeah, I'm just trying to like, you know, make the whole overall.

25:00 - daniel
  So it's like, if they fill this out ahead of time, I get to look at it before we have that scheduled call.  And I already know what the conversation needs to be instead of wasting 10 minutes on a call going through all this stuff to get to the part that we need.

25:15 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Does every new customer just fill it out one time or is it something? No, no. So they'll fill this out weekly.

25:21 - daniel
  So every week, like on a Friday, they'll fill out their weekly check-in form so they schedule their call.

25:31 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  I mean, there's a version of this where you can build a system, right? Like where you can build out a database that collects, like every person has a login.  And that's going to start getting too complicated where I don't want to get into that. Yeah. mean, honestly, like it's, it's not complicated to build, but you know, it's, it would cost time, right?

25:58 - daniel
  Yeah. Which I don't really want to. But like I said, like it, it'd be so much easier for me to have them be able to click a button, have a fillable form to fill out every week.  It gets sent to me, I review it, I call them, you know, that's it. Yeah. Okay. Let's, let's think about that.

26:14 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Let's, let's get through this form first. Okay. Uh, for the, for the onboarding form. So this is a client onboarding, but the, yeah, you send me client onboarding.  Let me see something here. So that's once they agree and sign up for the coaching, then this is all for, sorry, I think I got, I just want to clarify something.  Okay. So this is for clients not to be a coach.

26:42 - daniel
  Right. Okay.

26:43 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  That this might, that, that's a little confusing. Yeah, we can, that I don't care with that.

26:48 - daniel
  can change. That was just what the stupid chat GPT put on there.

26:54 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Okay. Okay. What do you, what do you think would be better? Right. I think it could be just a little clear.  I'm not, I don't think it's not something that needs to be scrutinized too much, but like when you say apply, there's an implication that you may not be chosen.

27:14 - daniel
  Well, that's kind of the idea of it. So it's like the whole point of going through the form and everything and doing all this stuff is first to see if we're, and I think it says in the, how coaching works, I'd have to double check it again.  It's, you have to see if that we're going to be a good fit first. If you know, this system is going to be right for you, you know, like chances are, are many people going to get declined?  No. But if I get somebody who's like, Oh yeah, want to do the coaching and I'm trying to do all this stuff that like, I'm like, that's not going to work.  Right. Yep. Um, but I don't know if apply for coaching sends the wrong message or if there's a better way to word that.  I think. I don't know. We can, we can think about it. Um, I guess, or it could just be sign up.

28:08 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Yeah, it could be sign up or yeah, I think it, yeah. Uh, we can, I can think of some options or just keep it.

28:17 - daniel
  All right. So we'll just leave it as a person.

28:20 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  It makes sense when you explain it. I think I only got that impression because of the other, the other business that you, that you.

28:27 - daniel
  Oh yeah. This is completely separate. No, I, I, I get that now. I think I was just completing it.  Now my onboarding form, that's, that's completely different from the intake form. Right?

28:42 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Oh, okay. Is it okay. You're telling me. Yeah. Well, I can't read it on the screen.

28:47 - daniel
  Okay. Sorry.

28:48 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  I, yeah, I will stop that. I shared the wrong form. I, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Fix that. Um, okay.

29:09 - daniel
  So it's building. I'm trying to see, like, is there a way to pull them up side by side to make sure, just to see that, make sure that they're different?  So that's the onboarding for me. sure they're different. Yeah.

29:22 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Cause this is the intake.

29:23 - daniel
  This is the intake. Yeah. The one that they first fill out.

29:27 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  This is, this is the one you titled the intake, but it says onboarding. Hold on.

29:36 - daniel
  Yeah. didn't know if onboarding intake. Okay. That's why.

29:39 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  So that's the onboarding intake form.

29:41 - daniel
  Okay. Got it.

29:42 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  And then you have, okay. I think that's the only form you had. Okay.

29:47 - daniel
  Okay.

29:47 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  So should be, should be okay then. Okay.

29:53 - daniel
  Yeah. I got to go through all this stuff and see if there's like a separate thing. I don't even know.  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, know, cause I'll have to make, you know, I'll have to have something on here. I'll, I'll either, you know, you might be better at it with your AI stuff than mine.
  ACTION ITEM: Draft + send contract/policy text to Adam; then Adam adds policies page - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/_pJxvsJyS4759DdvEzqZ8ggxq9NxK-ge?timestamp=1808.9999  Um, like I'll have to have something for them, you know, that basically illustrates, like, if they agree to the training, there's gotta be like a contract.  Right.

30:20 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Okay. That makes sense. Um, you know, cause I'll have to get like authorization to charge.

30:30 - daniel
  The credit card on there, um, and that they're agreeing to a certain amount of time type thing and, you know, cancellation policy.  Like I'll have to put, I mean, that's pretty easy. Hey, I can do that in like two minutes. So they can, but just in case I forget, I know you're recording this.  So like policy stuff that we have to have on there. We'll probably have to include on the website somewhere.  Yeah, that's all easy.

31:03 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  You can just hand it over and it'll make a page.

31:21 - daniel
  God, I don't know how you do this .

31:24 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  I'm deep. I'm deep in there, man.

31:28 - daniel
  I know. was telling my friend that because it's still tough for me. I know you handle now, like from what you told me, you do all like advertising and stuff for these companies.  Well, no, I'm like, I've been working independently.

31:38 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  I work mostly with smaller businesses now.

31:41 - daniel
  Oh, okay. So it's like, uh, when I was telling Anthony, so like Anthony has his, like Anthony, he's like top three in the entire company.  Yeah. like he's like a big seller and a lot of people in the office, like, you know, always want to copy what Anthony does, but he was telling them about the app stuff.  So he was like, Oh, I wonder if he could build and design like an app to kind of go along with my.  know. know what And I'm like, I'm sure you could. said, you know, and he's not afraid when it comes to his work stuff.  He's not afraid to spend money. Nice.

32:07 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Yeah. So I figured like, there you go.

32:10 - daniel
  Look, look, check it out. Okay. Apply for coaching. There's your form. Oh, awesome. That was quick. That's it's a lot of information.

32:22 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  And then they could submit. It's not that part's not there yet. It's going to make sure all this is filled out.

32:27 - daniel
  Yeah.

32:28 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  And then it'll send all of that to an email to you just while we were talking. It just  built that crazy.

32:35 - daniel
  Right.

32:38 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  And now I'm just like putting some nice polish on the site to make it fun and a little more flashy.  Very, very nice.

32:50 - daniel
  So, yeah.

32:51 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  So, you know, I'll, I'll let you, I'll, you know, when there's an updated version of this, I can. can.  can.

33:00 - daniel
  I probably send screenshots or video at this point because I don't I don't want to go through the motions of like putting it up because we're going to do that anyway with your own accounts yeah yeah no that's why I don't care as long as I could just see um go back to the can you can you show me the main landing page again like the top so I think let me see where's the photo can we do like the dance got to be a little more like the the one I sent you so like I like how it's got like the Dan and orange and the Scott and white and then it had like next to fitness the two lines up next to it we're like orange so closer to see if I had that example I probably I probably didn't even say you know what here no you didn't you send it to me I have it somewhere there is it oh yeah and I want to I make sure I get that tagline on there  Like in that beginning. Yeah. Cause that's like the whole basis of like the difference that, look at, look at this, the difference here versus here.

34:12 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  See?

34:13 - daniel
  Yeah. I don't know why that is. Where did this come from? That's I had it generate me a sample screen.

34:22 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  What was the source when you did that? What did you, where did this?
  ACTION ITEM: Fix hero image aspect; email Adam; then Adam updates hero - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/_pJxvsJyS4759DdvEzqZ8ggxq9NxK-ge?timestamp=2064.9999

34:26 - daniel
  Same thing I sent you. This right here? Yeah.

34:30 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Cause you look more proportionally accurate in here and here you look smushed.

34:35 - daniel
  So I think what it did, I could probably ask it to correct it. Cause it did it originally in the other one.  I think when it stretches it to the 16, nine, I think it elongates it a little bit. So I can ask it not to do that.

34:55 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Yeah. If you, yeah, if you can do that, that would be great. So you see what I mean? I'm not crazy, right?  Yeah, it stretched it a little bit like it got pulled.

35:06 - daniel
  Yeah, exactly. Um, yeah, I could, I could ask it to do that again. And then I'll send it to you and you tell me if it's like any better.  Okay. I don't know why I did that. Yeah, but I see what you're talking about. Yeah, it got pulled when it did the 16-9.  Yeah.

35:34 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  We can definitely make it look more like this.

35:39 - daniel
  You know, and I like how like, like, go back to yours again for a sec. Like you see how you have like the elevate stuff there.  Like I would definitely kind of like how the image I sent you how it's like, you want that? Yeah, like I like that.  Okay. Yeah, we don't like like in the top left corner how it has the dance. Scott also kind of matches like that.

36:00 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Yeah, might be a little bit hard. That's going to be hard to replicate.

36:05 - daniel
  Oh, no. The fonts and stuff don't have to be just like the coloring. Okay.

36:11 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  All right. Because getting the lines on the side of fitness, I'm not sure. No, I don't care about that.

36:15 - daniel
  Okay. I just like the coloring, how it's like the mix with the Dan Scott. I like the way it pops a little bit.  Right. Okay.

36:22 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  Yeah, that should not be a problem. Yeah, mean, it should be pretty.

36:30 - daniel
  I did it over here.

36:31 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  It looks pretty nice. That's all. It just made that based on what you said. So it's pretty cool.

36:37 - daniel
  All right. So you know what? When I get off with you, I'm going to see if I can fix that photo and I'll send it.  I'll email it to you and just tell me if it looks any better. All right. I'll send you a list of to do's.

36:48 - Adam Sandler (aisandler2@gmail.com)
  It'll be pretty short and then you do that and we can find the time to meet up. All right.  Perfect.

36:54 - daniel
  Alrighty. All right. Thanks, Adam. I appreciate it. Talk to you later. All right. Bye. Bye.
